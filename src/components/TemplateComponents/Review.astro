      "We hired Ian for two web projects: SolTecLabs.com & SolTecElectronics.com and would highly recommend his work. With just a small amount of direction given, Ian was able to create two well-designed sites that showcased our content and capabilities beautifully! His after-design follow-up is excellent as he worked closely with us on ironing out any/all small details until everything was perfected (unlike some web-designers that disappear when the check clears the bank!) Ian is somebody that you can count on long-term to work with you as your web-site needs continue to change and grow. His graphic art capabilities and creativity are quite impressive as well - great logo design work & web-page interface that all blend together nicely. He's quick to return an email or phone call & works within deadlines given too. Thanks Ian!",
